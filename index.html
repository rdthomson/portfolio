	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<img class='profile' src="assets/Profile_Picture.jpg" alt="Image of Ryan Thomson">
	<p>Currently a student at Edinburgh Napier University, I am passionate about the design and development of websites as well as the creation of digital content for the web. I have been studying in a range of computing areas for more than 5 years, which is where my interest in web design and development comes from. As I have such a strong interest in this area, I decided to study BSc (Hons) Web Design and Development at University and I am currently in my final year of the programme. After University, I would like to move into the web industry as a designer and developer.</p>

	<p>Outside of University and the web world, I work part-time on an IT Helpdesk and I regularly volunteer. In early 2018 I was diagnosed with testicular cancer and was greatly supported by the <a href="teeangecancertrust.org">Teenage Cancer Trust</a> and <a href="clicsargent.org.uk">CLIC Sargent</a>.</p>
