	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<img class='profile' src="assets/Profile_Picture.jpg" alt="Image of Ryan Thomson">
	<p>I am currently studying BSc (Hons) Web Design and Development at Edinburgh Napier University where I am in my final year. My main interest is in front-end development however I am keen to get as much experience in back-end development to enhance my skills.</p>
	<p>Outside of University and the web world, I work part-time on an IT Helpdesk and I regularly volunteer. In early 2018 I was diagnosed with testicular cancer and was greatly supported by the <a href="https://www.teenagecancertrust.org">Teenage Cancer Trust</a> and <a href="https://www.clicsargent.org.uk">CLIC Sargent</a> so I am currently looking for ways to raise funds for these amazing charties.</p>
