	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<img class='profile' src="assets/Profile_Picture.jpg" alt="Image of Ryan Thomson">
	<p>Currently a student at Edinburgh Napier University, I am passionate about the design and development of websites as well as the creation of digital content for the web. I have been studying a range of computing areas for more than 5 years, which is where my interest in web design and development comes from. As I have such a strong interest in this area, I decided to study BSc (Hons) Web Design and Development at University and I am currently in the second year of the programme. After University, I would like to move into the web industry as a designer and developer.</p>

	<p>Outside of University and the web world, I have a part-time job as a Crew Member at McDonalds and I regularly volunteer with Young Scot on a number of projects, including the Junior Climate Challenge Fund (JCCF) Youth Panel and the Young Scot Focus Group. I have also recently become a Young Ambassador for Vision Africa.</p>
