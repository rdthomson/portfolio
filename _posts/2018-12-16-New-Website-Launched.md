My new site has been live for a while now, and there is still a lot of work that I want to do to it. My current plan is to get some projects under my belt and uploaded to a projects page and I also want to work on making the site more responsive, however I have recently taken ill again and have been in and out of the hospital. Now normally, I would have said that this would help me with my plan as I would have loads of free time to work on things but this time round, my illness caused mobility issues down my right side meaning I couldn't walk without support and I had no control of my right hand. Thankfully this is improving with the treatment I am getting and I can now walk without any support at all and my hand is returning to normal. As my treatment in hospital continues over the next few months, I will be working on some projects which I hope won't only show the skills I am learning but it will also help my physical health as the use of the computer will build up the muscles in my hand and help it return to normal.

I've yet to decide what exactly I want to work on but whatever it ends up being, I'll be sure to share it. For now though, it's time to enjoy the festive period before returning to hospital in the lead up to the new year!
