As part of [national coding week](https://codingweek.org), I have worked to launch a redesign of my personal site. I created the site using Jekyll and using GitHub Pages to host it. Even though my site is now live, there is still a lot of work that I want to do to it. My current plan is to merge my [about](/about) and [skills](/skills) pages and replace my skills page with a projects page.
